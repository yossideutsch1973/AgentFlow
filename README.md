# AgentFlow

> Orchestrate smart agents with grace — fast to prototype, easy to scale.

AgentFlow is a lightweight, developer-friendly toolkit for composing, running, and observing conversational or task-oriented agents and agent networks. Whether you're experimenting with prompt-driven assistants, chaining tools, or building a full multi-agent pipeline, AgentFlow gives you the primitives to prototype quickly and keep your project production-ready.

This README aims to be both friendly and useful — think of it as a README that knows how to explain complex systems without making you yawn.

## Features

- Intuitive flow-based API for composing agents and tools
- Support for synchronous and asynchronous execution
- Easy-to-read examples for common agent patterns (chain, router, worker pools)
- Pluggable adapters so you can swap LLMs, vector stores, or tool connectors
- Observability-friendly: logs, simple tracing, and hook points for metrics
- Designed for local development and smooth migration to cloud deployments

## Quick start

Clone the repo and run the included examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yossideutsch1973/AgentFlow.git
cd AgentFlow
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

Run an example flow:

```bash
python examples/simple_flow.py
```

(Examples live in the `examples/` directory — read the files to see real agent compositions.)

## Example (conceptual)

Here's a compact, illustrative snippet to show the spirit of AgentFlow:

```python
from agentflow import Flow, Agent, Tool

# Tools wrap external capabilities (APIs, DBs, retrievers)
search_tool = Tool("web_search", lambda q: "Top results for: " + q)

# Agents encapsulate reasoning and prompts
class RetrievalAgent(Agent):
    def run(self, query):
        return search_tool.invoke(query)

class AnswerAgent(Agent):
    def run(self, context, question):
        # combine context & question, call an LLM adapter
        return "Answer based on: " + context + " >>> " + question

flow = Flow()
flow.add_agent("retriever", RetrievalAgent())
flow.add_agent("answer", AnswerAgent())

# Wire agents together
flow.connect("retriever", "answer", transform=lambda s: (s, "What's the summary?"))

# Run
result = flow.run("What's new about AgentFlow?")
print(result)
```

Note: the real APIs and names in the repository may differ; check the `examples/` and `docs/` folders for precise usage.

## Repository layout

- `agentflow/` — core library code
- `examples/` — runnable demos and mini-tutorials
- `tests/` — unit and integration tests
- `docs/` — design notes and reference documentation
- `scripts/` — helper and dev scripts

If your clone has a different structure, use that as your source of truth.

## Contributing

We love contributions — bug reports, documentation improvements, examples, and new adapters are all welcome.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-thing`
3. Add tests where appropriate
4. Open a pull request describing the change

Be kind in reviews, and add clear, actionable descriptions to PRs. If you're new and want a place to start, take a look at `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted` labels (if any).

## Roadmap & ideas

Some ideas we might work on (community welcome!):

- First-class orchestration for long-running, multi-step agent jobs
- Visual flow builder for rapid prototyping
- More LLM adapters and official tool connectors (Search, DBs, Vector stores)
- Built-in safety and rate-limiting middlewares
